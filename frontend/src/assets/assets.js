      "Choosing between buttercream and whipped cream can make or break your cake experience. Buttercream is rich, stable, and great for decorating, while whipped cream is light, airy, and delicate. Buttercream can hold intricate piping and withstand warmer conditions. Whipped cream, on the other hand, is best enjoyed chilled and adds a refreshing finish. At ChocoLush, we use both, depending on the style and mood of the cake. Understanding the texture, flavor, and use-case for each helps you pick the perfect topping for any occasion."
